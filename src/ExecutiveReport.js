                  {((reportData.blockedConnections / reportData.totalEntries) * 100).toFixed(2)}%) suggests that the current firewall configuration may be overly restrictive, impacting network performance and user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Frequent ICMP Blocks:</strong> A considerable number of ICMP packets are being blocked (
                  {reportData.icmpBlockedCount}). This may impede troubleshooting efforts, making it harder to diagnose network issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Application-Specific Issues:</strong> The high number of blocked connections for Firefox.exe (
                  {reportData.firefoxBlockedCount}) indicates potential misconfigurations, hindering user productivity.

                <li>
                  <strong>Enhance Monitoring Capabilities:</strong> Implement advanced monitoring tools to analyze blocked connections and identify patterns that could indicate security threats or misconfigurations.
